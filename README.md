## Purpose and Overview
The purpose of this demonstartion is to review analytic data of Citi Bike Sharing in New York City to assist our client in opening a branch of their own in Des Moines, Iowa. Using Pandas we converted the data in the "tripduration" to a datetime format and exported it back into our folder. The orignal csv, the pandas documentation, and the new csv can all be found in the Resources folder of the repository. Using Tableau we created visual data to more easily inform our investors on the success of bike sharing in other cities and how it could be prioftiable in Des Moine as well.
